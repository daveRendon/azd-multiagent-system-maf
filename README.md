# Building a Multi-Agent Support Triage System with AZD, Microsoft Agent Framework, and Microsoft Foundry

This repository provides a complete, end-to-end example of how to design, build, and deploy a production-ready multi-agent solution on Azure, leveraging the Microsoft Agent Framework and Microsoft Foundry resources.

We will recreate a ticket-triage system in which a primary agent delegates to three specialists: priority, team assignment, and effort estimation. Then, we will map it to a reference architecture and walk through deployment choices so you can ship it for real workloads.

This repository automates the scenario by provisioning Azure infrastructure with Bicep, deploying a FastAPI container to Azure Container Apps, and wiring the app to a multi-agent workflow in Microsoft Foundry.

The solution coordinates four agents:

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Priority | Classifies urgency (High / Medium / Low) | e.g., “High” |
| Team | Suggests the owning team | e.g., “Infra” |
| Effort | Estimates delivery effort with supporting rationale | e.g., “Medium – provide remediation steps” |
| Triage | Orchestrates the specialists to produce a consolidated ticket summary | e.g., “High priority • Infra • Medium effort” |

The repository adds operational conveniences that go beyond the lab handout, including automated infrastructure deployment, repeatable agent bootstrapping, rate-limit-aware verification, and a consolidated test harness with readable JSON traces for demos.

## Architecture Overview

```
Azure Resource Group (azd-multiagent)
├─ Azure Container Apps Environment
│  └─ Container App (FastAPI triage API)
│     ├─ Managed Identity
│     └─ Azure Container Registry image
├─ Azure Container Registry
└─ Microsoft Foundry Project
	├─ GPT-4o model deployment (capacity configurable)
	├─ Project connection (AAD)
	└─ Multi-agent graph (Priority, Team, Effort, Triage)
```

**Infrastructure as Code**: `infra/main.bicep` composes individual modules for the container app (`infra/modules/containerapp.bicep`), Microsoft Foundry resources (`infra/modules/foundry.bicep`), and container registry (`infra/modules/acr.bicep`).

**Application**: `src/api/app.py` hosts FastAPI endpoints that expose the triage capability. Environment variables emitted by the Bicep deployment provide the AI project endpoint and agent IDs.

**Automation scripts**:

- `scripts/bootstrap_agents.py` – creates or refreshes the specialist + triage agents with the Microsoft Agent Framework and persists their IDs to the current `azd` environment.
- `scripts/verify_agent.py` – verifies a single agent run with retry/backoff controls.
- `scripts/test_all_agents.py` – runs all four agents in one command; automatically loads environment values from `.azure/<env>/.env` and emits normalized JSON blocks for each participant.
- `scripts/bootstrap_agents.py` + `scripts/test_all_agents.py` supersede the manual Cloud Shell steps from the learning path.

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure subscription** with access to GPT-4o capacity in Microsoft Foundry.
2. **Azure Developer CLI (azd)** v1.9+ and the Azure CLI (`az`) installed locally.
3. **Python 3.12+** with `pip` available on your development machine.
4. **Docker** (builds the API image if you make code changes).
5. Sign in with `az login` before running any deployment commands.

> ℹ️ The lab document recommends manually creating the project and agents. This repository automates those steps; no Cloud Shell edits are necessary.

## Quick Start

### 1. Provision Infrastructure

From the repository root:

```pwsh
azd up
```

This command:

- Creates the Azure resource group and supporting resources.
- Deploys the FastAPI container image to Azure Container Apps.
- Provisions a Microsoft Foundry project, connection, and GPT-4o deployment (default capacity = 2, adjustable via `modelSkuCapacity`).

At the end of the run, `azd` populates `.azure/<env>/.env` with output values including:

- `AIFOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`
- `projectEndpoint` (camelCase alias)
- `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT`
- Container app URL (`apiUrl`)

### 2. Bootstrap the Agents

```pwsh
python scripts/bootstrap_agents.py
```

This script waits for DNS propagation, creates the **priority**, **team**, **effort**, and **triage** agents, and saves their IDs to the current `azd` environment:

- `PRIORITY_AGENT_ID`
- `TEAM_AGENT_ID`
- `EFFORT_AGENT_ID`
- `TRIAGE_AGENT_ID`

It also prints an environment snapshot and, when run with `--ticket`, writes the aggregated Microsoft Agent Framework response to `warmup.json` for easy sharing.

### 3. Test All Agents at Once

```pwsh
python scripts/test_all_agents.py --ticket "VPN outage affecting finance team"
```

`test_all_agents.py` automatically loads `.azure/<env>/.env`, maps the `projectEndpoint` alias if necessary, and prints the response from each agent using the Microsoft Agent Framework runtime. Output is rendered as compact JSON blocks so you can narrate each participant’s decision without additional formatting. Pass `--env-file` to point at a different environment snapshot.

Example output:

```
[PRIORITY]
[MessageRole.AGENT] High

[TEAM]
[MessageRole.AGENT] Infra ...

[EFFORT]
[MessageRole.AGENT] VPN outage remediation steps ...

[TRIAGE]
[MessageRole.AGENT] High priority • Infra • Moderate effort ...
```

### 4. (Optional) Verify Individual Agents

To test a single agent with granular retry controls:

```pwsh
python scripts/verify_agent.py `
  --agent-id $Env:TRIAGE_AGENT_ID `
  --ticket "VPN outage affecting finance team" `
  --max-attempts 12 `
  --initial-backoff 12 `
  --max-backoff 60 `
  --show-transcript
```

Use this command when debugging rate-limit behaviour or inspecting transcripts in detail.

## Alignment with the Lab Guide

The official instructions walk through four phases, each of which maps to automation in this repo:

| Lab Section | Manual Step | Repository Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Create a Microsoft Foundry project | Portal-based project creation, GPT-4o deployment | `infra/modules/foundry.bicep` (deployed by `azd up`) |
| Create an AI Agent client app – Prepare environment | Clone repo, set up Python environment | Included in this repo; no Cloud Shell setup needed |
| Create AI agents | Manually edit `agent_triage.py` | `scripts/bootstrap_agents.py` & `scripts/test_all_agents.py` automate agent creation and testing |
| Sign into Azure and run the app | Run `python agent_triage.py` interactively | FastAPI service + verification scripts provide automated and API-based execution |

If you’re following the lab for certification prep, you can use this repository to accelerate the “build” phase, then compare outputs against the step-by-step guide.

## Deploying Updates

1. **Modify application code** (e.g., update `src/api/app.py`).
2. Rebuild and redeploy:

	```pwsh
	azd deploy
	```

3. Re-run `python scripts/bootstrap_agents.py` whenever you change instructions or tear down the AI project resources.

---

## Cleanup

To remove all resources and avoid charges:

```pwsh
azd down
```

Alternatively, delete the resource group from the Azure portal (mirroring the “Clean up” section in the Microsoft Learn instructions).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Rate limits**: Increase `modelSkuCapacity` in `infra/modules/foundry.bicep` or adjust retry flags (`--max-attempts`, `--initial-backoff`, `--max-backoff`) on the verification scripts.
- **Agent not found**: Run `python scripts/bootstrap_agents.py` to refresh the agent IDs after redeployments or project resets.
- **Environment variables missing**: Ensure `.azure/<env>/.env` exists. You can supply an explicit file with `--env-file`.
- **Authentication errors**: Run `az login` and, if using managed identity locally, ensure you have access to the AI project.
